## Fall 2021 Google Colab Issues
As far as I can tell, the license behind Colab was changed in Sept 2021 restricting access to 18+. Here's some useful info so far:
- Recommended method for IT Admin to resolve issue: [https://support.google.com/a/answer/11254550](https://support.google.com/a/answer/11254550)
- Bug report and the most up-to-date info on solutions. Look for posts from admin cperry-goog toward the end [https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/2264](https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/2264)
