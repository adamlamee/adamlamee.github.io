### Upcoming talks  
I'll be leading a working session on *Course Design to Maximize Learning* at the 2023 Curriculum Alignment Conference in Daytona Beach. You can [view my slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p0dflX85-10PLgsbPuQOciwwEDP8KGyNQ1zWrke3CWc/edit?usp=sharing).  

### About Me  
I'm an educator, physicist, industrial engineer, and data scientist. I use those skills to advocate for students and teachers from K12 to university. I'm always interested in collaborating with curious minds who want to do great things. Send an email to adamlamee@gmail.com or read out more [about me](./about_me).  

### Coding in K12  
[Coding in K12](http://codingink12.org) offers a way for K12 teachers with no programming experience to give meaningful coding experiences to their students while also addressing regular course content. Embedding our coding activities into core courses improves equity and access, regardless of background or family income, for thousands of students. [Here's what that looks like](http://codingink12.org).  

### Supporting STEM Education  
Every high school student deserves a well-rounded science education to have equal access to STEM careers. For a student planning on any technical or academic work after high school, they need to have a full year each of Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. Making that happen may be easier than you think. Need to see some data to back that up? That's on my [STEM Education page](./stem_ed). I'm also active in the [Florida Chapter of the American Association of Physics Teachers](http://flaapt.us) and [Quarknet](https://quarknet.org/) particle physics outreach.  

### Recruiting Physics Teachers  
Since 2015 I've been the PhysTEC Teacher-in-Residence in the UCF Physics department where I recruit STEM majors to consider teaching high school Physics when they graduate. Check out the [UCF PhysTEC site](https://sciences.ucf.edu/physics/phystec/) for more info.  

### MeatPlotLib  
A little project spoofing Python's ubiquitous Matplotlib graphing module and shining a spotlight on meat-themed data viz at [meatplotlib.org](./meatplotlib).
