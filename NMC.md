# Local Guide to the National Mentoring Community matteing @ UCF  
Orlando has great things to offer whether you're interested in craft beer and food, an amazing LGBTQ+ community, live music, or sports. I'm an Orlando resident, President of the Florida section of AAPT, and PhysTEC Teacher-in-Residence at UCF Physics. FYI: this page is mine and not affiliated with the NMC.  

## Getting around  
- Welcome to central Florida! We don't do mass transit for visitors very well. Without a rental car? We have lots of Uber and Lyft. Taxis, busses, and trains aren't as helpful here.

## Things to do and eat
- The site of the Pulse nightclub attack has become a beautiful tribute to love and loss ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/DJxc84khhE7oyWPz8)). It's a 20-minute drive toward downtown that's worth your while.  
- [Habanero's Mexican Grill](https://www.habanerosgrillmexican.com/) is tasty and has several locations, including one near UCF.  
- [Cafe Caobana](https://cafe-caobana.business.site/) Get great Cuban coffee and food, plus practice your Spanish.  
- [Skycraft Parts & Surplus](https://skycraftsurplus.com) is a cross between Radio Shack, 7-11, Army surplus, and NASA junkyard. Looking for 200 stainless ball bearings, bulk LEDs, or an oscilloscope from SkyLab? Leave room in your suitcase. Open 8:30AM-6:00PM Saturday, closed Sunday.  
- The [Morse Museum](http://www.morsemuseum.org/) has a stunning collection of Tiffany stained glass, the largest in the world. Closed Mondays.  
- Park Ave. ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/msrpBg1EfgMrAozC7)) is a high-end shopping and dining area. Great for a stroll and people watching, too.  
- [Disney Springs](https://www.disneysprings.com/) is a nearby shopping and eating district with all things Disney. The conference hotel [provides a shuttle every evening](https://www.cariberoyale.com/faq/do-you-have-transportation-to-the-local-theme-parks/).  
- International Drive([map](https://goo.gl/maps/3QwtpwBMib8DzS1e8)), we call it "I-Drive", has loads of restaraunts and activities. Try the outstanding [Cafe TuTu Tango](http://cafetututango.com/), reservations help.   
- Lake Eola([map](https://goo.gl/maps/RC6pp2j4uvkZu2Cq9)) is our lovely urban lake, famous for its swans and oddly-shaped fountain. Nice dining options, too.  
- Want to feel like you aren't in a city? Downtown's Dickinson Azalea Park and Langford Park ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/qzoEBdYA77Bjdt6AA)) are gorgous and serene.  
- [Drunken Monkey Coffee Bar](https://goo.gl/maps/kL2YvT4usvm3xEmk6) is local favorite with some of the best vegan options around (non-vegan stuff, too).
- [Pom Pom's Teachouse and Sandwicheria](https://goo.gl/maps/7MukA6eoMxDPqk1d8) will be one of the highlights you'll share when people ask you "how was AAPT?"
