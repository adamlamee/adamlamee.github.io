<h3>Do students need to learn how to program?</h3>
<p>There's increasing momentum for coding in schools and that's a good thing. Every student should be exposed to computer programming -- equal access to lucrative careers depends on it. However, a dedicated computer science course is not the answer for all (or even most) students. Math and science courses are prime territory for this task. Here are some ways my colleagues and I are making that happen. Have a question or want to contribute? Send me an email at adamlamee@gmail.com.</p>

<h3>Current projects</h3>
	<p>Our goal is to use computer programming as a tool to address science content. you won't see loops and conditionals taught explicitly, but that allows non-CS-fluent teachers to use these with their science classes nearly as-is. The coding is secondary. Check back in for developments on pure computer science activities in 2017-18. Take a look at what we're up to. Check out these <a href="https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/adamlamee/CODINGinK12-binderFiles/master?filepath=index.ipynb" target="_blank">interactive coding activities</a> hosted on MyBinder.org. If it doesn't launch automatically, try a different browser (not IE or Echo). See the <a href="https://github.com/adamlamee/CODINGinK12-binderFiles" target="_blank">source files on GitHub</a>. These resources are free to use and modify, but not for resale. If you're a teacher using this with your own students, let us know how you're implementing it (because we're interested in that sort of thing). Others: see <a href="https://github.com/adamlamee/CODINGinK12-binderfiles"> the project's GitHub</a> for more details on usage and license.</p>	
	<p>Need another reason to envy how <b>Seminole County Schools</b> does science? We're working with them to integrate coding activities into every 6th and 7th grade grade science class for the 2017-18 school year with 8th grade soon to follow. Imagine arriving to high school with three years of scientific computing experience ... wow. Here are some activities developed by experienced educators, computer scientists, and UCF undergraduates.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://beta.mybinder.org/repo/SCPSscience/Notebook" target="_blank">Interactive activities</a> including student worksheets developed by the amazing Bryan Turner (Milwee MS) and Adam Goodman (Markham Woods MS)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Want to work more this stuff? Install Jupyter on your own computer with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QKQzZZMluGtZysF5Qb0Hz4gMC8_1JHm0hliEvESzSV8/pub">this how-to guide</a></li>
	<p> My colleagues and I also conduct teacher workshops and district-wide professional development on coding, the Physical Science content, reformed pedagogy, and digital literacy. Drop a line to adamlamee@gmail.com if you'd like to learn more.</p>

<h3>More resources</h3>
<p><a href="https://code.org/">code.org</a> is the go-to place for fun, free activities for teachers and students to learn about coding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Code Academy</a> has great self-paced courses to teach yourself a programming language or new job skill. One of my former students used it to learn Python in a weekend, got a developer job that Monday, and a year later is at a cool startup, all without a college degree. And that's not uncommon.</p>
<p><a href="http://opendata.cern.ch/?ln=en">CERN Open Data</a> includes educational resources on particle physics and offers students (and the general public) the opportunity to access and analyze authentic data for the Large Hardon Collider. Yeah, it's pretty cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://particle-physics-playground.github.io/">Particle Physics Playground</a> provides Jupyter notebook exercises with particle detector data from CMS and CLEO.</p>
