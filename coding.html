<article><h1>Coding in K12</h1></article>

<article>
<p>There's a big push now for coding in schools. Every student should be exposed to computer programming. Equal access to lucrative careers depends on it. However, a dedicated computer science course is not the answer for all (or even most) students. Math and science courses are prime territory for this task, particularly high school Physics. Here are some ways my colleagues and I are making that happen. Have a question or want to contribute? Send me an email at adamlamee@gmail.com.</p>

<article><h3>Our approach</h3>
<p><b>Python</b> is a programming language that's among the easiest to learn, is widely used in research and industry, and can handle serious computational tasks. For coding with K12 students, this has become a (fairly) clear favorite. If you're already familiar with another language (e.g., C, Java), Jupyter can work with those, too.</p>
<p><b>Jupyter notebooks</b> include formatted text, links, and images along with code which can be run section-by-section or all at once. Jupyter natively support over 40 programming languages and itâ€™s free. More info at <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Project Jupyter</a>.</p>
<p>We use <b>Binder</b> to make these Jupyter notebooks accessible online and interactive from any device with a browser. More info at <a href="http://mybinder.org/">Binder</a>.</p>
<p>To edit and run these Binder-shared notebooks, you only need a browser. No Jupyter or compiler install is necessary. It even runs on mobile devices. Consider a class of high school students, each doing their own Higgs analysis of LHC data from their phones. Pretty cool, huh?</p>

<article><h3><a href="http://mybinder.org/repo/adamlamee/k12scicomp" target="_blank">Resources for educators</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://mybinder.org/repo/adamlamee/k12scicomp" target="_blank">Here are some coding activities</a> developed by experienced educators, computer scientists, and UCF undergraduate volunteers. These resources are geared for teachers to use with their students as-is or freely-modify. Please give credit if your use goes beyond one teacher with their own students and let us know how you're implementing them (because we're interested in that sort of thing). My colleagues and I also conduct teacher workshops and district-wide professional development on coding, the Physical Sciences, reformed pedagogy, and digital literacy.</p>
