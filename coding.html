<article><h1>Coding in K12</h1></article>

<article>
<p>There's a big push for coding in schools and that's a good thing. Every student should be exposed to computer programming -- equal access to lucrative careers depends on it. However, a dedicated computer science course is not the answer for all (or even most) students. Math and science courses are prime territory for this task. Here are some ways my colleagues and I are making that happen. Have a question or want to contribute? Send me an email at adamlamee@gmail.com.</p>

<h3>Current Projects</h3>
<p>Need another reason to envy how Seminole County Schools does science? We're working with them to integrate coding activities into each of their middle grade science classes next year. Imagine arriving to high school with three years of scientific computing experience ... wow.</p>

<p>Here are some coding activities developed by experienced educators, computer scientists, and UCF undergraduate volunteers.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://mybinder.org/repo/adamlamee/CODINGinK12-notebooks" target="_blank">Interactive versions</a> (this'll take 2-3 min to load). Still not loading? Check the status of the deploy server <a href="http://mybinder.org/status" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/adamlamee/CODINGinK12-static" target="_blank">Static versions</a> (for when the interactive server is down)</li>
	<li>Source files on <a href="https://github.com/adamlamee">GitHub</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please give credit if your use goes beyond one teacher with their own students and let us know how you're implementing this (because we're interested in that sort of thing). My colleagues and I also conduct teacher workshops and district-wide professional development on coding, the Physical Science content, reformed pedagogy, and digital literacy. Drop a line to adamlamee@gmail.com if you'd like to learn more.</p>

<article><h3>Our approach</h3>
<p><b>Jupyter notebooks</b> include formatted text, links, and images along with code which can be run section-by-section or all at once. Jupyter natively support over 40 programming languages and itâ€™s free. More info at <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Project Jupyter</a>.</p>
<p><b>Python</b> is a programming language that's among the easiest to learn, is widely used in research and industry, and can handle serious computational tasks. For coding with K12 students, this has become a (fairly) clear favorite. If you're already familiar with another language (e.g., C, Java), Jupyter can work with those, too.</p>
<p>We use <b>Binder</b> to make these Jupyter notebooks accessible online and interactive from any device with a browser. To edit and run these Binder-shared notebooks, you only need a browser. No Jupyter or compiler install is necessary. It even runs on mobile devices. Consider a class of high school students, each doing their own Higgs analysis of LHC data from their phones. Pretty cool, huh? More info at <a href="http://mybinder.org/">Binder</a>. The Binder server is down sometimes (<a href="http://mybinder.org/status">check status</a>), but hey, it's a free service provided by the amazing team at <a href="http://thefreemanlab.com/">The Freeman Lab</a>.</p>

<article><h3>Join the project</h3>
<p>Want to help out? You can contribute any amount of time and on your own schedule. We can always use volunteers to develop Jupyter notebooks on new topics, design lesson plans, expand the documentation and how-to files, translate to other (human) languages, and work one-to-one with teachers interesting in using these resources in their classrooms. Don't know how to code, but want to learn? Looking for undergraduate research credit? Send an email to adamlamee@gmail.com to get started.</p>
