<p>There's a big push for coding in schools and that's a good thing. Every student should be exposed to computer programming. Equal access to lucrative careers depends on it. However, a dedicated computer science course is not the answer for all (or even most) students. Math and science courses are prime territory for this task, particularly high school Physics. Here are some ways my colleagues and I are making that happen. Have a question or want to contribute? Send me an email at adamlamee@gmail.com.</p>
<p>Need another reason to envy how well Seminole County Schools does science? We're working with them to integrate coding activities into their 6th, 7th, and 8th grade science classes for next year. Imagine that -- arriving to high school with three years of scientific computing experience? wow.</p>

<article><h3>Resources for educators</h3>
<p>Here are some coding activities developed by experienced educators, computer scientists, and UCF undergraduate volunteers.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://mybinder.org/repo/adamlamee/k12scicomp" target="_blank">Interactive versions</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/adamlamee/K12SciCompStatic" target="_blank">Static versions</a> (if the interactive server is down)</li>
	<li>Source files on <a href="https://github.com/adamlamee">GitHub</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These resources are geared for teachers to use with their students as-is or freely-modify. Please give credit if your use goes beyond one teacher with their own students and let us know how you're implementing them (because we're interested in that sort of thing). My colleagues and I also conduct teacher workshops and district-wide professional development on coding, the Physical Sciences, reformed pedagogy, and digital literacy.</p>

<article><h3>Our approach</h3>
<p><b>Python</b> is a programming language that's among the easiest to learn, is widely used in research and industry, and can handle serious computational tasks. For coding with K12 students, this has become a (fairly) clear favorite. If you're already familiar with another language (e.g., C, Java), Jupyter can work with those, too.</p>
<p><b>Jupyter notebooks</b> include formatted text, links, and images along with code which can be run section-by-section or all at once. Jupyter natively support over 40 programming languages and it’s free. More info at <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Project Jupyter</a>.</p>
<p>We use <b>Binder</b> to make these Jupyter notebooks accessible online and interactive from any device with a browser. More info at <a href="http://mybinder.org/">Binder</a>.</p>
<p>To edit and run these Binder-shared notebooks, you only need a browser. No Jupyter or compiler install is necessary. It even runs on mobile devices. Consider a class of high school students, each doing their own Higgs analysis of LHC data from their phones. Pretty cool, huh?</p>

<article><h3>Join the project</h3>
<p>Want to help out? You can contribute any amount of time and on your own schedule. We can always use volunteers to develop Jupyter notebooks on new topics, design lesson plans, expand the documentation and how-to files, translate to other (human) languages, and work one-to-one with teachers interesting in using these resources in their classrooms. Don't know how to code, but want to learn? Looking for undergraduate research credit? Send an email to adamlamee at gmail dot com to get started.</p>

<article><h3>Seminole County Schoools 6-8 Coding in Science</h3>
<p>Seminole County Schools, a FL District which consistently does a great job in science, is working with us to include codingn activities embedded into the middle grades Science curriculum.
