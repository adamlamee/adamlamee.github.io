<h3>Do student's need to learn how to program?</h3>
<p>There's increasing momentum for coding in schools and that's a good thing. Every student should be exposed to computer programming -- equal access to lucrative careers depends on it. However, a dedicated computer science course is not the answer for all (or even most) students. Math and science courses are prime territory for this task. Here are some ways my colleagues and I are making that happen. Have a question or want to contribute? Send me an email at adamlamee@gmail.com.</p>

<h3>Current Projects</h3>
<p>The focus of these activities is to expose students to using computer programming as a tool to solve problems and answer questions. They are fully-functioning scripts that perform some task (like making a graph of a large data set) and require students to edit the program to answer a more specific question (like plotting of a particular subset of the data and re-label it). Teachers can use these activities to address their course content instead of needing to free up additional class time. These are science activities which use coding, not programming instruction, so you won't see lessons on topics like loops and conditionals. Those elements are used and commented on, but not explicitly taught (or needed to be taught here). The trade off is leaving behind traditional Computer Science instruction for the few students enrolled in a dedicated CS course in favor of exposing all students to coding in a practical way. The teacher needs a few days of training, but does not need to be a fluent programmer, and students don't have to sacrifice a foreign languge, math, or science class to learn some coding.</p>
<p>Need another reason to envy how <b>Seminole County Schools</b> does science? We're working with them to integrate coding activities into each of their middle grade science classes next year. Imagine arriving to high school with three years of scientific computing experience ... wow. Here are some activities developed by experienced educators, computer scientists, and UCF undergraduates.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://mybinder.org/repo/adamlamee/codingink12-binderfiles" target="_blank">Interactive demos</a> via MyBinder.org (this can take up to 2-3 min to load). Still not loading? Check the status of the deploy server <a href="http://mybinder.org/status" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/adamlamee/CODINGinK12" target="_blank">All produced and in-works activities</a> (not interactive)</li>
	<li>These resources are free to use and modify, but not for resale. If you're a teacher using this with your own students, let us know how you're implementing it (because we're interested in that sort of thing). Others: see <a href="https://github.com/adamlamee/CODINGinK12"> the project's GitHub</a> for more details on usage and license.</li>
</ul>
<p> My colleagues and I also conduct teacher workshops and district-wide professional development on coding, the Physical Science content, reformed pedagogy, and digital literacy. Drop a line to adamlamee@gmail.com if you'd like to learn more.</p>

<h3>More resources</h3>
<p><a href="https://code.org/">code.org</a> is the go-to place for fun, free activities for teachers and students to learn about coding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Code Academy</a> has great self-paced courses to teach yourself a programming language or new job skill. One of my former students used it to learn Python in a weekend, got a developer job that Monday, and a year later is at a cool startup, all without a college degree. And that's not uncommon.</p>
<p><a href="http://opendata.cern.ch/?ln=en">CERN Open Data</a> includes educational resources on particle physics and offers students (and the general public) the opportunity to access and analyze authentic data for the Large Hardon Collider. Yeah, it's pretty cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://particle-physics-playground.github.io/">Particle Physics Playground</a> provides Jupyter notebook exercises with particle detector data from CMS and CLEO.</p>
