# How is district_title doing in science?  
Two things to consider when studying the plots below are:  
- Chemistry and physics aren’t just for future physicists and engineers. Students who take chemistry and physics are more competitive in trade/technical programs and careers. They’re also four times more likely to graduate college on time.  
- Low overall enrollment in chemistry and physics courses usually comes with an underrepresentation of girls and students of color in those courses.  

Most schools with high chemistry and physics enrollment have two things in common:  
- Little to no gender or racial gap in enrollment demographics
- A registration process that places students into chemistry and physics courses by default with an easy way to opt out – a parent or guardian personally calls or comes in to sign an override form.
