# How is district_title doing in science?  
Two things to consider when viewing the plots below are:  
- Chemistry and physics aren’t just for future physicists and engineers. Students who take chemistry and physics are more competitive in trade/technical programs and careers. They’re also _**four times**_ more likely to graduate college on time.  
- Low overall enrollment in chemistry and physics courses is usually accompanied by an underrepresentation of girls and students of color in those courses.  

Most schools with high chemistry and physics enrollment have two things in common:  
- The have reduced or eliminated the gender and racial gap in enrollment.  
- They register students for chemistry and physics courses _**by default**_ and provide an easy way to opt out – a parent or guardian personally calls or comes in to sign an override form.
