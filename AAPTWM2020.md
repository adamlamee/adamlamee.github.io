# Local Guide to the AAPT 2020 Winter Meeting  
Orlando has great things to offer whether you're interested in craft beer and food, an amazing LGBTQ+ community, live music, or sports. I'm an Orlando resident, President of the Florida section of AAPT, and PhysTEC Teacher-in-Residence at UCF Physics. This page is mine and not affiliated with the [AAPT 2020 Winter Meeting](https://www.aapt.org/Conferences/wm2020/index.cfm). If you can't find what you're looking for here, drop me a line at adamlamee@gmail.com or catch me at my talk *Modern Research Data to Enrich the K12 Classroom* 2:00 Sunday.  
## Getting around  
- Welcome to central Florida! We don't do mass transit for visitors very well. Without a rental car? We have lots of Uber and Lyft. Taxis, busses, and trains aren't as helpful here. Also see the hotel shuttle, below.    
## Near the workshops
Workshops are held 35 minutes north of the conference hotel at Rollins College ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/UJw99uWWwfKghbXw9)) in Winter Park. While you're there, try  
- Brunch at [The COOP](https://asouthernaffair.com/) 10:AM Saturday with some Florida AAPT folks and Quarknet staff. This will be the best southern food outside of your granma's kitchen you'll have all year.  
- [Skycraft Parts & Surplus](https://skycraftsurplus.com) is a cross between Radio Shack, 7-11, Army surplus, and NASA junkyard. Looking for 200 stainless ball bearings, bulk LEDs, or an oscilloscope from SkyLab? Leave room in your suitcase. Open 8:30AM-6:00PM Saturday, closed Sunday.  
- The [Morse Museum](http://www.morsemuseum.org/) has a stunning collection of Tiffany stained glass, the largest in the world. Closed Mondays.  
- Park Ave. ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/msrpBg1EfgMrAozC7)) is a high-end shopping and dining area. Great for a stroll and people watching, too.  
## Near the Conference  
- The site of the Pulse nightclub attack has become a beautiful tribute to love and loss ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/DJxc84khhE7oyWPz8)). It's a 20-minute drive toward downtown that's worth your while.  
- [Disney Springs](https://www.disneysprings.com/) is a nearby shopping and eating district with all things Disney. The conference hotel [provides a shuttle every evening](https://www.cariberoyale.com/faq/do-you-have-transportation-to-the-local-theme-parks/).  
- International Drive([map](https://goo.gl/maps/3QwtpwBMib8DzS1e8)), we call it "I-Drive", has loads of restaraunts and activities. Try the outstanding [Cafe TuTu Tango](http://cafetututango.com/), reservations help.  
## Near Downtown    
- Lake Eola([map](https://goo.gl/maps/RC6pp2j4uvkZu2Cq9)) is our lovely urban lake, famous for its swans and oddly-shaped fountain. Nice dining options, too.  
- Want to feel like you aren't in a city? Downtown's Dickinson Azalea Park and Langford Park ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/qzoEBdYA77Bjdt6AA)) are gorgous and serene.  
- [Drunken Monkey Coffee Bar](https://goo.gl/maps/kL2YvT4usvm3xEmk6) is local favorite with some of the best vegan options around (non-vegan stuff, too).
- [Pom Pom's Teachouse and Sandwicheria](https://goo.gl/maps/7MukA6eoMxDPqk1d8) will be one of the highlights you'll share when people ask you "how was AAPT?"
