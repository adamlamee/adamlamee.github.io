## Blue Meatball vs. Red Worm

It's 2020 and amid a global pandemic [two graphic powerhouses](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/symbols-of-nasa.html) are duking it out. Which one will win? The meatball is meaty, but worms are also made of meat (probably not as tasty though). [SpaceX](https://www.space.com/nasa-worm-logo-is-back-spacex-demo-2-rocket.html) has chosen a side. Are you still on the fence? This [design-focused history of NASA's logos](https://www.wired.com/2015/09/nasa-graphics-standards-manual/) may help.  

## Down with the pie: a subtle argument for bacon  
![Bacon plot](https://www.darkhorseanalytics.com/blog/salvaging-the-pie)  
This lovely ditty comes from the killer data vis blog from [Darkhorse Analytics](https://www.darkhorseanalytics.com/blog), written by [Joey Cherdarchuk](https://www.darkhorseanalytics.com/joey/). While the author is Canadian, the bacon is strikingly linear.  

## The Porkchop Plot  
The plot that started it all. It's a meat-based rocket logistics visualization. Here's a [nice summary from NASA JPL](https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/spotlight/porkchopAll.html). ht to rocket scientist [Caley Burke](https://www.caleyburke.com/) for sharing some wisdom.

## Contribute a meatplot  
Do you have a plot from your own awesome science that resembles bacon, fat back, or ribs? Maybe a feature request? Drop a line and I'll post it here.  

## What is this new mpl?  
I'm still trying to figure that out. It began with learning about porkchop plots from a talk given by NASA's [Caley Burke](https://www.caleyburke.com/) in early 2018 swiftly followed by purchasing this domain. Tomorrow is anyone's guess.
