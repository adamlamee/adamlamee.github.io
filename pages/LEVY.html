	<h1>tl;dr</h1>
	<p>Enroll high school students by default into Chemistry and Physics. They'll thank you later (and so will their parents). And it'll probably solve your STEM diversity problem. Universities and tech companies will thank you later, too.</p>
	<h1>How is Levy County doing in science?</h1>

		<p>A well-rounded education gives students the best opportunities in college and careers. Recommendations from research and professional organizations can be found <a href="./whyPhysics.html">here</a>. The highlights are:<br />
		<ul>
			<li>Most students should be taking Biology, Chemistry, and Physics in high school.</li>
			<li>U.S. States and other countries doing this well have a Physics-taking rate of greater than 80%; Florida's is around 20%.</li>
			<li>We don't need all students to be career scientists, but not taking Chemistry and Physics closes the door to the most lucrative college and trade jobs if the student changes their mind later.</li>
			<li>Students with Chemistry and Physics credit in high school are four times as likely to graduate college on time than their peers. That holds for STEM and non-STEM degrees alike.</li>
			<li>Professional societies recommend the same for trade and technical programs.</li>
			<li>The sequence of those courses is less important than ensuring students take them.</li>
			<li>These subjects are not inherently more challenging than others. Courses may be taught at range of levels; regular and honors courses should play a significant role in a school’s offerings.</li>
			<li>Lowest-performing students still deserve a full year each of a life, physical, and earth science.</li>
			<li>Physical Science and Earth/Space Science are a great courses but can be difficult to include in a 4-year progression allowing for three years for Biology, Chemistry, and Physics.</li>
		</ul></p>

		<h2>Enrollment trends</h2>
		<p>Relative enrollment of content areas can be seen in the 4-year enrollment trends in first-year Biology, Chemistry, and Physics courses. "1st-year" courses were identified as typical first exposure in the content area by the course codes for 1, 1 honors, and pre-IB/pre-AP/pre-AICE. AP Biology was included, since some schools offer that as a first-time course. In Physics, that also included AP 1 since some schools offer that as a first-year Physics course. Schools use unique progression plans and I don't assume to know what those are on a site by site basis. If it makes a difference to your district's plots, let me know and I’ll be happy to post updates.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If Biology represents a total, what fraction of students take Chemistry? How many take Physics?</li>
				<li>What fraction of students don’t take both Chemistry and Physics? How does that compare with the percent of students not planning to pursue college or technical training?</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Individual course enrollment</h2>
		<p>Enrollment is shown for individual courses, sorted by highest enrollment and limited to the 15 most-enrolled. Bars are color-coded for courses in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Physical Science, and Earth/Space Science. Gray bars represent courses which should be treated as electives taken concurrently or after coursework in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Are the most-enrolled courses color-coded? Are there gray bars in the top five? Are those students also taking Chemistry and Physics?</li>
				<li>Does your district default to enrolling students in Chemistry and Physics? Is that choice apparent in the demographic plots below?</li>
			</ul>

		<p>Similar plots for individual schools in each Florida school district can be viewed <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1l9nFRCdMZOeyW47wqCw5HrfmMJt-m39T">here</a>.</p>

		<h2>Demographic trends</h2>
		<p>The best predictor of gender and racial equity in high school science courses is total enrollment. When more students are enrolled into Chemistry and Physics courses, disparities in gender and race tend to be reduced. Schools that enroll students into Chemistry and Physics by default have little to no loss in the diversity of students taking those courses. Schools that leave science registration up to student choice exhibit the largest disparities.</p>
		<p>The plots below show the diversity in course enrollment, by content area. Each point includes errorbars, though most aren’t large enough to be visible. This stems from student privacy protections in the source data. When fewer than 10 students in a demographic category are enrolled in a course, the number is not published. If your district is small or has low enrollment in a subject area, the errorbars may be so large as to make any inference meaningless.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Since Biology is a required course, it can serve as a good estimate of the demographic averages for the district.</li>
			<li>How do the rates for Chemistry and Physics compare to those for Biology?</li>
			<li>If a content area is less diverse than Biology, does the course enrollment bar chart above indicate high enrollment in other courses which may be less beneficial to students in the long term?</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>About the data</h2>
		<p>These analyses were performed by <a href="http:\\www.adamlamee.com">Adam LaMee</a>. The data came from the Florida Department of Education. Course enrollment data is readily available from the <a href="http://www.fldoe.org/accountability/data-sys/edu-info-accountability-services/pk-12-public-school-data-pubs-reports/students.stml">FL DOE site</a>. Enrollment demographics were provided via data request from the fine folks at FLDOE. If you'd like to see your district's data in a different form or have edited plots, I'll be happy to help.
