# Local Guide for scientists and educators visiting UCF and the Orlando area 
Orlando has great things to offer whether you're interested in craft beer and food, an amazing LGBTQ+ community, live music, or sports. I'm an Orlando resident, President of the Florida section of AAPT, and PhysTEC Teacher-in-Residence at UCF Physics. This page is mine and not affiliated with any other organization. If you can't find what you're looking for here, drop me a line at adamlamee@gmail.com.  

## Getting around  
- Welcome to central Florida! We don't do mass transit very well, but we have lots of Uber and Lyft if you're without a rental car. Taxis, busses, and trains aren't as helpful here.  

## Near the city center
- The site of the Pulse nightclub attack has become a beautiful tribute to love and loss ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/DJxc84khhE7oyWPz8)). It's worth any visitor's while.  
- [Drunken Monkey Coffee Bar](https://goo.gl/maps/kL2YvT4usvm3xEmk6) is local favorite with some of the best vegan options around (non-vegan stuff, too).
- [Pom Pom's Teachouse and Sandwicheria](https://goo.gl/maps/7MukA6eoMxDPqk1d8) will be one of the highlights you'll share when people ask you "how was oyur trip?"  
- Lake Eola([map](https://goo.gl/maps/RC6pp2j4uvkZu2Cq9)) is our lovely urban lake, famous for its swans and oddly-shaped fountain. Nice dining options, too.  
- Want to feel like you aren't in a city? Downtown's Dickinson Azalea Park and Langford Park ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/qzoEBdYA77Bjdt6AA)) are gorgous and serene.  

## Near UCF  
- [4 Rivers Smokehouse](https://g.page/4RUCF?share) makes some of the finest BBQ in town. I reccommend the brisket, pulled pork, mac and cheese, buent ends, ribs, fried okra, BBQ chicken, ...  
- [Lazy Moon](https://www.lazymoonpizza.com/) is college pizza place you're looking for with 36" slices and a good beer selection.  
- [Habanero's Mexican Grill](https://goo.gl/maps/2sNhdJT5Gx4k1Avm9) has great food and prices.  
- The [UCF Arboretum](https://arboretum.ucf.edu/) ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/Lp9z2sqGas6BTq4q9)) offers a nice walk through native surroundings.  

## North of downtown & Winter Park  
- Brunch at [The COOP](https://asouthernaffair.com/) will be the best southern food outside of grandma's kitchen you'll have all year.  
- [Skycraft Parts & Surplus](https://skycraftsurplus.com) is a cross between Radio Shack, 7-11, Army surplus, and a NASA junkyard. Looking for 200 stainless ball bearings, bulk LEDs, or an oscilloscope from SkyLab? Leave room in your suitcase. Open 8:30AM-6:00PM Saturday, closed Sunday.  
- The [Morse Museum](http://www.morsemuseum.org/) has a stunning collection of Tiffany stained glass, the largest in the world. Closed Mondays.  
- Park Ave. ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/msrpBg1EfgMrAozC7)) is a high-end shopping and dining area. Great for a stroll and people watching.  

## Near the theme parks  
- [Disney Springs](https://www.disneysprings.com/) is a nearby shopping and eating district with all things Disney.  
- International Drive([map](https://goo.gl/maps/3QwtpwBMib8DzS1e8)), we call it "I-Drive", has loads of restaraunts and activities. Try the outstanding [Cafe TuTu Tango](http://cafetututango.com/) (reservations help).
